AWRAMS CONTRIBUTOR LICENCE AGREEMENT (FOR INDIVIDUALS AND LEGAL ENTITIES)

This contributor agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to the Commonwealth of
 Australia as represented by the Bureau of Meteorology ("Us"). To make this document effective, please sign
 it and send it to Us (by email to awracms@bom.gov.au).

1. Definitions
    "You" means as applicable the individual ("natural person") or organisation ("legal entity") who Submits
     a Contribution to Us.
    "Contribution" means any work of authorship or invention that is Submitted by You to Us in which You own
     or assert ownership of any intellectual property rights (IP), including without limitation any
     copyright, patent rights or related rights. If You do not own IP in the entire work of authorship or
     invention, please clarify the basis on which the work of authorship or invention was created,
     contributed or used by You (where indicated in clause 3 below).
    "Material" means the work of authorship or invention which is made available by Us to third parties.
     When this Agreement covers more than one software project, the Material means the work of authorship or
     invention to which the Contribution was Submitted. After You Submit the Contribution, it may b
     included in the Material.
    "Submit" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Us or our
     representatives, including but not limited to electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us for the purpose of discussing and
     improving the Material.
    "Effective Date" means the date You execute this Agreement or the date You first Submit a Contribution
     to Us, whichever is earlier.

2. Grant of Rights
  2.1 Copyright License
   (a) You retain ownership of the copyright in Your Contribution and have the same rights to use or license
        the Contribution which You would have had without entering into the Agreement.
   (b) To the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
        non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright licence covering the Contribution,
        with the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce,
        modify, display, perform and distribute the Contribution as part of the Material.

  2.2 Patent License
       For patent claims including, without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims which You own,
        control or have the right to grant, now or in the future, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
        non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent licence, with the right to sublicense
        these rights to multiple tiers of sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import
        and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in combination with the Material (and
        portions of such combination). This licence is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the
        licensed rights infringes such patent claims.

  2.3 Outbound License
       Based on the grant of rights in clauses 2.1 and 2.2, if We include Your Contribution in Material, We
        may license the Contribution under any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or
        proprietary licenses.

  2.4 Moral Rights
       If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree
        not to assert such moral rights against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees,
        either directly or indirectly.  In addition, You consent to Us or our successors in interest or
        licensees using the Contribution consistently with the terms of this Agreement for moral rights
        purposes. If You are an organisation or not the moral rights holder, You agree to obtain written
        consents from the authors of the relevant parts of the Contribution to allow Us or our successors in
        interest or licensees to use the Contribution consistently with the terms of this Agreement for moral
        rights purposes.

  2.5 Our Rights
       You acknowledge that We are not obliged to use Your Contribution as part of the Material and may
        decide to include any Contribution We consider appropriate.

  2.6 Reservation of Rights
       Any rights not expressly licensed under this clause are expressly reserved by You.

3. Agreement
    You warrant and represent that:
    (a) You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement.
    (b) You own or otherwise have rights in respect of the copyright and patent claims covering the
         Contribution which are required to grant the rights under clause 2.
    (c) the grant of rights under clause 2 does not violate any grant of rights which You have made to third
         parties, including Your employer. If You are an employee, You have had Your employer approve this
         Agreement or sign another copy of this document. If You are less than eighteen years old, please
         have Your parents or guardian sign the Agreement.
    (d) the Contribution does not contain any malicious code, virus or any intentionally deleterious
         modification.
    (e) If You do not own the IP in the entire work of authorship or invention Submitted, the legal basis on
         which You have created or used the work of authorship or invention and on which You have legal
         authority to enter into this Agreement and to grant the licence rights under this Agreement is as
         follows:

4. Disclaimer
    EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN CLAUSE 3, THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY,
     ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
     MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU
     TO US. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN
     DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

5. Miscellaneous
  5.1 This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Australian Capital
       Territory excluding its conflicts of law provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law
       in this clause might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
       International Sale of Goods ("UN Convention") and the parties intend to avoid the application of the
       UN Convention to this Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention in its
       entirety to this Agreement.

  5.2 This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Us for Your Contributions to Us and
       overrides all other agreements or understandings.

  5.3 If You or We assign the rights or obligations received through this Agreement to a third party, as a
       condition of the assignment, that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and
       obligations in the Agreement.

  5.4 The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this
       Agreement in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any
       time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation shall not be
       considered a waiver of the performance of the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision
       in its entirety.

  5.5 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to
       the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and
       which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply
       notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the
       maximum extent possible under law.
